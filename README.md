Here’s a README file for your Image Encrypter and Decrypter project:
Image Encrypter and Decrypter

This application encrypts and decrypts images using a simple XOR operation with a user-defined key. The tool features an intuitive graphical user interface (GUI) that allows you to select input and output files and specify the encryption/decryption key.
Features

    File Browser: Easily select input image files and specify output paths.
    Supported Formats: Handles various image formats like .png, .jpg, .jpeg, .bmp, .tiff, and .webp.
    Key-Based Encryption: Uses a numeric key (0–255) to perform XOR-based encryption or decryption.
    User-Friendly Interface: Clean and simple GUI built using Python's Tkinter.

Installation

    Prerequisites:
        Python 3.x installed on your system.
        Required Python libraries: Pillow and numpy.

    Install Dependencies: Run the following command in your terminal or command prompt:

    pip install pillow numpy

    Clone or Download:
        Clone the repository or download the source files.

Usage

    Run the script:

    python main.py

    Use the GUI:
        Click the Browse button to select the input image.
        Click the Browse button to specify the output file path.
        Enter an encryption key (integer between 0 and 255).
        Click Process Image to encrypt or decrypt the file.

    Encrypted File:
        The output file can be viewed, shared, or decrypted by running the tool again with the same key.

How It Works

    Encryption:
        The input image is read as an array of pixel values.
        Each pixel value is XORed with the encryption key.
        The modified pixel values are saved as the output image.

    Decryption:
        The encrypted image is XORed with the same key to retrieve the original image.

Error Handling

    Ensures input file exists and is a valid image.
    Validates encryption key is an integer within the 0–255 range.
    Provides clear error messages for any issues.
